#### Objective

Once a document is approved, the state change must be synchronized across the backend, database, and visible application screens. This section explains why data update is important in a moderated workflow like CloudDoc.

#### Update Steps

**Step 1:** Change the document state from `pending` to `approved` in the database.

**Step 2:** Reflect the updated state in the admin dashboard so moderators can see the changes.

**Step 3:** Reflect the updated state in the search page. The frontend must fetch the fresh data to keep the system consistent for users.

**Step 4:** Allow preview and download options for the approved document in the user interface.
