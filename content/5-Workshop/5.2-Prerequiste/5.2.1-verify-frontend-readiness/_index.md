#### Objective

This step verifies that the main components are working before document upload begins. The purpose is to make sure any later failure can be traced to workflow logic rather than a missing infrastructure prerequisite.

#### Verification Steps

Before uploading documents, please verify the following infrastructure conditions:

**Step 1:** Ensure the **Frontend** is reachable in the browser and verify the **CloudFront** distribution configuration.

**Step 2:** Verify that the **S3 buckets** are visible in the AWS Console, and ensure they are ready for storage and access.

**Step 3:** Check that the **EC2 instance** is running the backend service properly and the **API backend** responds correctly.

**Step 4:** Ensure the **RDS PostgreSQL** database is available and ready to store document metadata.

**Note:** Checking the infrastructure thoroughly at this stage makes troubleshooting much easier during later integration steps.
