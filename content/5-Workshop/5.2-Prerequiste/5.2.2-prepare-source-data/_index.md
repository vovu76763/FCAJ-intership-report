#### Objective

This step prepares the sample document and verifies the configuration required for browser-to-S3 upload. Because the file is uploaded directly from the browser, the bucket configuration, CORS rules, and environment variables must align correctly.

#### Execution Steps

Before starting the direct browser-to-S3 upload flow, ensure the storage configurations are set correctly:

**Step 1:** Verify the **CORS configuration** on the upload S3 bucket to allow `PUT` or `POST` requests directly from the browser.

**Step 2:** Configure **Public access** for the frontend bucket, ensuring public access is not entirely blocked so static files can be served.

**Step 3:** Enable **Static website hosting** on the frontend bucket and point the index document to `index.html`.

**Note:** In addition to these S3 settings, prepare a sample document (like a PDF) and confirm that frontend and backend environment variables match.
