#### Objective

After a document is approved, users need a natural application flow for preview and download. At the same time, a complete workshop should also demonstrate operational visibility, not just deployment. This section therefore combines client integration with AWS observability.

#### Integration and Observability Steps

**Step 1:** The frontend loads document information from the backend, securely distributed via **CloudFront**.

**Step 2:** The backend issues safe access URLs. Users can seamlessly **preview and download** the approved documents.

**Step 3:** **CloudWatch** collects backend logs and runtime metrics to ensure proper operational visibility.

**Step 4:** A **CloudWatch alarm** demonstrates proactive monitoring to track runtime anomalies.
